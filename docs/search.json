(2021) How do environmental policies affects green innovation and trade? Evidence from the WTO environmental database (EDB). (WTO staff paper, will be published in July 2021)\r\n\r\nWhat is the EDB?\r\nThe WTO Environmental Database (EDB) is a collection of environment-related policies notified to WTO Members. For each policy, the database contains a description of the measure and information on the economic sector, the type of instruments used and the environmental goal pursued by the policy.\r\nThe EDB is organised in two distinct datasets according to the sources of its information: the Trade Policy Reviews (TPR) and Member notifications. TPR are are periodical assessment of Members’ policies organised by the WTO. Their aim is to draw a systematic profile of the Members’ trade policies and practices. The latest version of the TPR and notification datasets are downloadable as an Excel or CSV file from: https://edb.wto.org/search.\r\nWhat is the EDB data extension?\r\nThe EDB contains a wealth of information on environmental policies implemented across the world. It is one of the most comprehensive databases on this subject. However, much of its information is encoded in a textual format. This makes it hard to use it in quantitative research projects.\r\nOur goal is to make the database more accessible for research and policy analysis by extracting and extending the set of available information using text analysis techniques. The data provided in this webpage is an extended version of the official EDB notification dataset. On top of the variables of the official EDB, our dataset includes additional columns containing information that we extract algorithmically from the EDB. A full description of our approach is available in Bellelli and Xu (2021).\r\nClick on the tabs below to explore the main features of the EDB extension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImplementation years\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Measures in force vs notified (EDB v.2018)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n In its current form, the EDB notification dataset is organised along the year of notification of policy measures. However, researchers are usually interested in the year of implementation of the measure. That is to say, the year in which the policy enters into force and, if applicable, when its implementation ends.\r\nOur EDB extension contains information on the starting and ending year of policy measures’ implementation, which we extracted from the textual description present in the original EDB.\r\n\r\nHS chapters\r\nSince the reporting obligations are not uniform across WTO agreements, the structure of notifications and the set of information provided vary according to the agreement under which the measure was notified. Only about a quarter of the notified measures report an HS or ICS code describing the goods to which it relates. Having an idea of the goods affected by the other measures could be useful for trade related research.\r\nOur EDB extension identifies possible 2-digits HS codes for 90% of the measures in the database. We use natural language processing techniques to parse the description of the measures and identify potential links with HS codes. The linkage is based on how well the wording in the description matches the products listed in HS chapters. We then use information on economic sector and environmental goals of the measure to narrow down the potential matches.\r\nCountries\r\nFor multi-state Members (e.g. European Union), we identify all countries affected by the policy measure. This should make it easier to merge the database with country-level economic data or plot maps.\r\nMoreover, our data extension is available in three formats: measure, country-measure, country-measure-HS chapter. In the first, each line of the dataset corresponds to a notified environment-related policy (just like the original EDB). In the second one, entries are also split according to the countries they affect: Every line corresponds to a country-measure combination. Finally, the last format is also split for the 2-digits HS codes affected by the policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Number of environment-related measures by country (EDB v.2018)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilar measures\r\nSome of the policy measures in the EDB have been renewed or notified multiple times. Therefore, the same measure might appear multiple time at different dates. To help identifying these measures, we developed an index of measure similarity. The index is calculated from the proportion of words in the measure descriptions that pairs of measures share in common.\r\nHS/ICS detection\r\nAbout a quarter of all notified measures in the EDB report an HS or ICS code describing the goods to which it relates. These are two product classifications commonly used to categorise trade flows.\r\nOne obstacle in using this information is that ICS and HS codes are mixed together in the original EDB dataset. To make matters worse, ICS and HS codes look very similar: they are both sequences of numbers. We address this issue by identifying and separating HS, ICS and ambiguous codes in three separate columns.\r\nPolicy score\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Policy score components\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe attempt to build an indicator of measure strength based on the information in the EDB database. Our measure score is built along two conceptual dimensions: the policy breadth and depth. We consider as broad, measures that affect a larger share of the economy and tackle multiple environmental issues. On the other hand, the depth of a measure refers to the intensity of its provisions. We base our depth scoring on the type of policy instrument used in the measure and the wording of the measure description.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDB extension updates\r\nThe EDB notification dataset gets updated annually by the WTO secretariat. As a new version comes out, we will update the EDB extension to provide information on the latest measures in the database. We designate EDB’s version by the latest notification year included in their data. For example, the latest release (EDB v.2019) includes measures notified up to 2019.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBellelli, Francesco Saverio, and Ankai Xu. 2021. “How do environmental policies affect green innovation and trade?

(2021) Interest groups and participation in international environmental agreements. Working paper. Available from https://fbellelli.com/ratification-data.html.\r\n\r\nWhat is this dataset?\r\nInternational environmental agreements (IEAs) — such as the Paris agreement on climate change, the CITES agreement on the trade of endangered species, or the Montreal Protocol on ozone-depleting substances — are our primary tools for solving transboundary environmental issues. This dataset collects information on the ratification (i.e. participation) status of countries in 263 environmental agreements. It tracks the ratifications of over 200 countries between 1950 and 2017. A particularity of this dataset is that it identifies for every agreement the countries that can potentially ratify it. This feature is very useful for research applications.\r\nA full description of the collection method and coding criteria is available in the data appendix of Bellelli, Scarpa, and Aftab (2021), which can be found here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Number of IEA ratifications by 2017\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nData coverage and sources\r\nWe have two main sources for the date and status of ratification of treaties: The ENTRI (CIESIN 2013) and the IEA (Mitchell 2017) Databases. The IEA database is our primary source of information, while the ENTRI database was used to cross-check some of the information in the IEA database.\r\nOur dataset contains only agreements and protocols to the agreements are taken into consideration, while amendments are ignored. The agreements in our sample relate to any of the following areas of interest: 1) protection of the environment in general, 2) species protection, 3) pollution (air, land and water), 4) habitat and ecosystem preservation. The dataset excludes energy agreements, nuclear non-proliferation treaties or any agreement that does not make explicit reference to environmental issues either in their title or text. Finally, the dataset covers only multilateral agreements with at least five potential ratifiers. That is to say, it does not cover bilateral treaties and very small multilateral agreements.\r\nPotential ratifiers\r\nWe define as potential ratifier any country that could ratify a given agreement. This includes any nation for which the treaty is open to ratification and that is affected by the environmental issues tackled by the agreement. The\r\nStudies looking a treaty design and membership have traditionally assumed that all countries could ratify international agreements. However, this is clearly not the case. Most of the environmental agreements are regional — they tackle localised environmental issues, such as the protection of a specific ecosystem or species, or are initiated by regional organisations (e.g. European Union, the African Uniopn, or the Caribbean and Pacific group of States). This leads to biased estimates and erroneous conclusions in studies including regional agreements in their sample. Identifying potential ratifiers can solve this problem and allow researchers to study regional agreements.\r\nKnowing which country can ratify an agreement also allows to build a ratification rate indicator, which is a better indicator of international environmental cooperation than simple count of treaty membership. As shown in the image below, not all countries have access to the same number of agreements. Hence, the number of memberships in international agreements is driven by the number of agreements they can potentially ratify.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Number of potential ratifications by country\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBellelli, Francesco Saverio, Riccardo Scarpa, and Ashar Aftab. 2021. “Interest Groups and Participation in International Environmental Agreements.” Working Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIESIN. 2013. “Environmental Treaties and Resource Indicators (ENTRI).” Center for International Earth Science Information Network.\r\n\r\n\r\nMitchell, R.
