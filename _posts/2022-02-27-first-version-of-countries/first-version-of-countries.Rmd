`countries` is an R package designed to quickly wrangle, merge and explore country data. This package will contain functions to easily identify and convert country names, pull country info and datasets, merge country data from different sources, and make quick world maps.

I recently released the first development version of the package, which is now available on my [Github page](https://github.com/fbellelli/countries). The package also has a [website](https://fbellelli.github.io/countries/) containing information on the package's usage.

In this article, we will have a look at how `countries` can be used to work with country name. In particular, we will look in detail at the function `country_name()`, which can be used to convert country names to different naming conventions or to translate them to different languages. `country_name()` can identify countries even when they are provided in mixed formats or in different languages. It is robust to small misspellings and recognises many alternative country names and disused official names.

## Installing and loading the package

Since the package is not yet on CRAN, the development version needs to be downloaded directly from the Github repository. This can be done with the `devtools` package.

```{r , eval=FALSE}
# Install and load devtools
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
# Install countries
devtools::install_github("fbellelli/countries", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

The package can then be loaded normally

```{r}
library(countries)
```

## Dealing with country names

The function `country_name()` can be used to convert country names to different naming conventions or to translate them to different languages. 

```{r}
example <- c("United States","DR Congo", "Morocco")
# Getting 3-letters ISO code
country_name(x= example, to="ISO3")
# Translating to spanish
country_name(x= example, to="name_es")
```

If multiple arguments are passed to the argument `to`, the function will output a `data.frame` object, with one column corresponding to every naming convention.

```{r}
# Requesting translation to French and 2-letter and 3-letter ISO codes
country_name(x= example, to=c("name_fr","ISO2","ISO3"))
```


The `to` argument supports all the following naming conventions:




```{r echo=FALSE}
tab <- data.frame(CODE=c("**simple**","**ISO3**","**ISO2**","**ISO_code**","**UN_**xx","**WTO_**xx","**name_**xx","**GTAP**", "**all**"),
           DESCRIPTION=c("This is a simple english version of the name containing only ASCII characters. This nomenclature is available for all countries.",
                         "3-letter country codes as defined in ISO standard `3166-1 alpha-3`. This nomenclature is available only for the territories in the standard (currently 249 territories).",
           "2-letter country codes as defined in ISO standard `3166-1 alpha-2`. This nomenclature is available only for the territories in the standard (currently 249 territories).",
           "Numeric country codes as defined in ISO standard `3166-1 numeric`. This country code is the same as the UN's country number (M49 standard). This nomenclature is available for the territories in the ISO standard (currently 249 countries).",
           "Official UN name in 6 official UN languages. Arabic (`UN_ar`), Chinese  (`UN_zh`), English  (`UN_en`), French  (`UN_fr`), Spanish  (`UN_es`), Russian (`UN_ru`). This nomenclature is only available for countries in the M49 standard (currently 249 territories).",
           "Official WTO name in 3 official WTO languages: English (`WTO_en`), French (`WTO_fr`), Spanish (`WTO_es`). This nomenclature is only available for WTO members and observers (currently 189 entities).",
           "Translation of ISO country names in 28 different languages: Arabic (`name_ar`), Bulgarian (`name_bg`), Czech (`name_cs`), Danish (`name_da`), German (`name_de`), Greek (`name_el`), English  (`name_en`), Spanish  (`name_es`), Estonian (`name_et`),  Basque (`name_eu`),  Finnish (`name_fi`), French (`name_fr`), Hungarian (`name_hu`), Italian (`name_it`), Japponease (`name_ja`), Korean (`name_ko`), Lithuanian (`name_lt`), Dutch (`name_nl`), Norwegian (`name_no`), Polish (`name_po`), Portuguese (`name_pt`), Romenian (`name_ro`), Russian (`name_ru`), Slovak (`name_sk`), Swedish (`name_sv`), Thai (`name_th`), Ukranian (`name_uk`), Chinese simplified (`name_zh`), Chinese traditional (`name_zh-tw`)",
           "GTAP country and region codes.", "Converts to all the nomenclatures and languages in this table"))
knitr::kable(tab)
```





## Further options and warning messages

`country_name()` can identify countries even when they are provided in mixed formats or in different languages. It is robust to small misspellings and recognises many alternative country names and old nomenclatures.  

```{r}
fuzzy_example <- c("US","C@ète d^Ivoire","Zaire","FYROM","Estados Unidos","ITA")
country_name(x= fuzzy_example, to=c("UN_en"))
```

More information on the country matching process can be obtained by setting `verbose=TRUE`. The function will print information on:

* The number of unique values provided by the user. In the example below 6 distinct strings have been provided.
* How many country names correspond exactly to the ones in the function's reference list and how many have been recognised with fuzzy matching. In the example below, `"C@ète d^Ivoire"` is the only name recognised with fuzzy matching. The function's reference table can be accessed with the command `data(country_reference_list)`.
* The function prints summary statistics on fuzzy matching. The DISTANCE metric refers to the number of insertions, deletions or substitutions necessary to go from the provided string (`"C@ète d^Ivoire"`) to the closest reference (`"Côte d'Ivoire"`). Lower DISTANCE statistics indicate more reliable fuzzy matching.  


```{r}
country_name(x= fuzzy_example, to=c("UN_en"), verbose=TRUE)
```

In addition, setting `verbose=TRUE` will also print additional informations relating  to specific warnings that are normally given by the function:

* `Multiple country IDs have been matched to the same country name`: This warning is issued if multiple strings have been matched to the same country. In verbose mode, the strings and corresponding countries will be listed. In the example above, both `"US"` and `"Estados Unidos"` are matched to the same country. If the vector of country names is a unique identifier, this could indicate that some country name was not recognised correctly. The user might consider using custom tables (refer to the next section).
* `Some country IDs have no match in one or more country naming conventions`: indicates that it is impossible to find an exact match for one or more country names with `fuzzy_match=TRUE`. The user might consider using `fuzzy_match=TRUE` or custom tables (refer to the next section). 
* `There is low confidence on the matching of some country names`: This warning indicates that some strings have been matched poorly. Thus indicating that the country might have been mididentified. In verbose mode the function will provide a list of problematic strings (see the example below). The user might consider using custom tables to solve this type of issues (refer to the next section). 
* `Some country IDs have no match in one or more country naming conventions`: Conversion is requested to a nomenclature for which there is no information on the country. For instance, in the example below "Taiwan" has no correspondence in the [UN M49 standard](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/). In verbose mode, the function will print all the country names affected by this problem. The user might consider using custom tables to solve this type of issues (refer to the next section). 

```{r}
country_name(x= c("Taiwan","lsajdèd"), to=c("UN_en"), verbose=FALSE)
```

All the information from verbose mode can be accessed by setting ´simplify=FALSE´. This will return a list object containing:

* ´converted_data´: the normal output of the function
* ´match_table´: the conversion table with information on the closest match for each country name and distance metrics.
* ´summary´: summary values for the distance metrics
* ´warning´: logical value indicating whether a warning is issued by the function
* ´call´: the arguments passed by the user

## Using custom conversion tables

In some cases, the user might be unhappy with the naming conversion or no valid conversion might exist for the provided territory. In these cases, it might be useful to tweak the conversion table. The package contains a utility function called ´match_table()´, which can be used to generate conversion tables for small adjustments. 

```{r}
example_custom <- c("Siam","Burma","H#@°)Koe2")
#suppose we are unhappy with how "H#@°)Koe2" is interpreted by the function
country_name(x = example_custom, to = "name_en")
#match_table can be used to generate a table for small adjustments
tab <- match_table(x = example_custom, to = "name_en")
tab$name_en[2] <- "Hong Kong"
#which can then be used for conversion
country_name(x = example_custom, to = "name_en", custom_table = tab)
```






## Work in progress

I am still working on the package. In the near future, the following items will be added to the package:

* function to test strings on whether they are country names
* functions to identify columns in dataframes containing country names and date information
* function for downloading up-to-date information on countries (e.g. currency, language, population, etc.)
* function for downloading country data for analysis from different sources (e.g. UN, World Bank, FRED, etc.)
* function to quickly merge country data from different sources
* function to tag countries based on common criteria (e.g. developing status, World bank income group, geographic region, etc.) 
* function to easily plot chloropleth maps
* publish on CRAN
