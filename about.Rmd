## A little bit about myself

I am an applied economist, with interests ranging from macroeconomic and financial forecasting, to trade, machine learning, climate and environmental issues. 

After completing a PhD in economics at Durham University, I went on working in the banking industry and for international organisations in Geneva. In the last two years, I worked as a research economist at the World Trade Organization (WTO), where I got involved in several projects related to trade and the environment.


I like to apply economics to real world problems and provide insights for decision making. Over the past years, I analysed and wrote about macroeconomic issues, developed economic forecasting models, created new datasets on environmental policies, applied advanced text analysis and machine learning techniques, developed programming libraries, and even served as economic expert in international trade disputes.
