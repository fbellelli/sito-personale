## A little about myself

I am an applied economist, with interests ranging from climate and environmental issues, to trade, innovation policies and macroeconomic forecasting. 

Born in Brazil, and grown up around the world, I have spent most of my life travelling.  After completing a PhD in economics at Durham University, I went on working in the banking industry and for international organisations in Geneva. 

At the moment I work as a research economist at the World Trade Organization (WTO), where I am involved in several projects related to trade and the environment.
